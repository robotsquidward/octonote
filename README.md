[OctoNote]() is a powerful markdown note editor that saves your notes to GitHub as Gists.  This repository is essentially the POC for OctoNote that I developed during and after WWDC 2018.  

This POC includes examples of formatting a UITextField for Markdown, some initial OAuth2 work, and a very simple app UI.
